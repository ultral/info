I was putting things in order in a garage, when I found an arithmometer Felix M. It is old school iron gadget, there are no electronics inside.

Ages ago, my father used to work as an engineer. He had used a student slide rule & a piece of sheet for calculating, so, he bought an arithmometer Felix M in 1978 for increasing calculation speed. It was the decline of the arithmometers. On one hand, it was possible to buy an Elektronika B3-18A, but on the other hand, a price was stratospheric, The price was 220rub, but an engineer salary was about 120-140rub. However, an arithmometer price was 15rub. An arithmometer price was winning argument & my father bought it. Interesting fact: the Felix M is a great traveller. It was bought in Cherepovets, moved to from Vladivostok to Baikonur, stayed in Chelyabinsk and finally moved to Saint Petersburg.

## Review

The arithmometer weight is about 5kg. It was stored in a garage about 20-25 years. As a result, doesn't look really good, however, it works fine.

## Demo

How does it work? I've prepared [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U05uwaLKv2Q). Let's multiply 11 by 321:

1. Select *11*.
2. The 1st turn — multiple by *1*.
3. Right shit by *1*.
4. The 2nd turn — multiple by *20* and increase the previous result.
5. Right shit by *1*.
6. The 3rd turn — multiple by *300* and increase the previous result.
7. The result is *3531*.
