[Russian version](how-to-improve-your-town.md)

There are a lot different ways to improve your town, as an expert in this area, I'd like to share my expirience.


## housing and utilities service provider

On one hand it should be the fastest way to solve issues, but on the other hand the keen on ignoring emails. It means that without official office call & conformation that they have received the email, they will ignore your email. It's not really useful, becuase of waste of time.


## gorod.gov.spb.ru

It's really useful & friedly service, especially in case of mobile application. Mobile app use case looks like:
* See an issue.
* Take the picture.
* Send the issue.
* Wait some months.
* Done

Usually they forward issues to housing and utilities service providers. They really good in standard solve issues solving:
* Broken fence.
* Dirty elevator
* Broken screaking swing.
