# How to interact with housing and utilities service provider and don't go nut

[Russian version](how-to-mange-tasks.md)

I'd like to share my experience how to interact with housing and utilities service provider and be sane.

![manage it](assets/uk.jpg?raw=true "manage it")
 
## Before beginning

1. I created [trello](https://trello.com) dashboard.
2. I configured trello to collect emails from `blahblah_trello_import@example.com` & create cards from an email. 
3. I synced trello & google calendar.
 
## How it looks?
 
1. There are two ways to create new card: 
    * Write email to housing and utilities service provider & BCC `blahblah_trello_import@example.com`. 
    * Write complain to [letters.gov.spb.ru](https://letters.gov.spb.ru/) & manually create card via [trello web site](https://trello.com) or mobile app.
2. I episodically look through trello dashboard & update due date & labels for new cards. 
3. If I get result or new information then I update status in trello for related card. 
 
## Workflow

1. TODO - backlog.
2. Sended - issue was sended to housing and utilities service provider.
3. WIP - housing and utilities service provider got it. 
4. Supervisory - housing and utilities service provider ignores the issue, it was redirected to related supervisory authorities.
5. Police - supervisory authorities ignore or overdue the issue, it was redirected to police
6. DONE - the issue was fixed.

## Conclusion

It looks a bit strange however it works.
