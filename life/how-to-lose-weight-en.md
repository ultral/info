## Introduction

First of all I googled couple of a calorie calculator. I tracked my diet: food weight & calories. I received information about my total daily energy expenditure - how many calories I consumed per day. After that:

1. I slightly decreased my diet. 
2. I looked at my weight.
3. Di it decrease? NO - go to step #1.
4. I found daily balance between my activity & diet.

Nothing special, just math:

* D - Daily energy expenditure
* A - Additional activity(walking, cycling, swimming, etc) per day.
* C - consumed calories per day.

```
X = D + A - C
```

**Ð¥** should be less than 200 calories per day. It means that you should move more for 200 calories than eat.

**Eat less, move more**

## More details

1. On one hand you don't have to reduce your diet more than for 200 calories, but on the other hand if you do it, you might feel bad because it is stressful for your body.
2. Stress is not allowed!!!
3. It means that you should not break your casual diet at once. It should be continuous process of changes.
    * In my case it took about 2-3 months.

        3. Eat 3-7 days `T - 200 calories`.
        4. If weight doesn't decrease, GOTO step #1.
        5. Wait some days with the same **T**, just to check.
