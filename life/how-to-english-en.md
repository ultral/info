[Russian version](how-to-english.md)

One one hand I don't want to be final authority, but on the other hand I'd like to share my point of view how to learn english. English language is not secret knowledge; it is just a lot of hard training. One of the most important bullet is constantly improve English. You should do it from day to day if you want to approach result. It must not be loathe torture for you, It means that you should find out something interesting in that process.

# Let's begin

Vocabulary, grammar, reading & audition are possible to train at home without teacher. It depends on your patience, determination & systematicity. Let's go to tools. 

1. Vocabulary: [lingualeo.com](https://lingualeo.com). It is great service with good enough web user interface & mobile applications. I use it for improving passive vocabulary (from texts & videos). However some persons prefer anki.
2. Audition: (without subs!!!):
  * Series [Extr@ English](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0FGv16ltX9NPty8Jad6BTq8yClsJDA-m). On one hand it is dumb as tree, but on the over hand it's really easy to understand.

4. Reading - just read. I found out that it's really easy to read Harry Potter.

Few months or years later as a result you should have big enough passive vocabulary & be able to understand english voice. 

# Show must go on

At the next stage, I suppose that you would like to improve your speaking. First of all you should convert thoughts into english speech(**not translate!!!**). How to dealt with it?

1. You have to read, read a lot, really a lot.
2. You should write, i.e. private diary.
3. **Speak**.

**Q:** Is it possible to speak english without speaking? 
**A:** No.

# Conclusion

How to learn continuously? It's sophisticated question. I use something like GTD/S.M.A.R.T. 
1. Goals have to be **S**pecific **M**easurable **A**ssignable **R**elevant **T**ime-based: 
  * I will read Harry Potter book to the end of current month.
  * I'm listening english made simple podcast №100 during today comute. 
2. I don't have enough time for that. Don't be lier.
  * You comute by subway – do X tasks at ligualeo.
  * You go to walk with chilldren or cycle – listen podcasts.
  * You cook diner - watch extr@ English.
3. Don't wait a result after 1 week/month, don't compare yourself with another, just learn.
