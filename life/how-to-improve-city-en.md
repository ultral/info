# How to improve your town and don't go nuts

*Date: 2020-03-26*

[Russian version](how-to-improve-city-ru.md)

I'd like to share my experience how to interact with housing and utilities service provider and be sane.

![manage it](assets/uk.jpg?raw=true "manage it")

## Before beginning

1. I created [trello](https://trello.com) dashboard.
2. I configured trello to collect emails from `blahblah_trello_import@example.com` & create cards from an email.
3. I synced trello & google calendar.

## How it looks?

1. There are two ways to create new card:
    * Write email to housing and utilities service provider & BCC `blahblah_trello_import@example.com`.
    * Write complain to [letters.gov.spb.ru](https://letters.gov.spb.ru/) & manually create card via [trello web site](https://trello.com) or mobile app.
2. I episodically look through trello dashboard & update due date & labels for new cards.
3. If I get result or new information then I update status in trello for related card.

## Workflow

1. TODO - backlog.
2. Sended - issue was sended to housing and utilities service provider.
3. WIP - housing and utilities service provider got it.
4. Supervisory - housing and utilities service provider ignores the issue, it was redirected to related supervisory authorities.
5. Police - supervisory authorities ignore or overdue the issue, it was redirected to police
6. DONE - the issue was fixed.

## Conclusion

It looks a bit strange however it works.

# How to improve your town

There are a lot different ways to improve your town, as an expert in this area, I'd like to share my expirience.

## housing and utilities service provider

On one hand it should be the fastest way to solve issues, but on the other hand the keen on ignoring emails. It means that without official office call & conformation that they have received the email, they will ignore your email. It's not really useful, becuase of waste of time.

## gorod.gov.spb.ru

It's really useful & friedly service, especially in case of mobile application. Mobile app use case looks like:
* See an issue.
* Take the picture.
* Send the issue.
* Wait some months.
* Done

Usually they forward issues to housing and utilities service providers. They really good in standard solve issues solving:
* Broken fence.
* Dirty elevator
* Broken screaking swing.
